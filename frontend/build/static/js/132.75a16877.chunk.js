You may request to delete your account and/or have your data deleted by sending a request to <a href="hello@thecocoapp.com">hello@thecocoapp.com</a> from the email address associated with your account. However, not providing information we request, deleting your account, or deleting your data may restrict your ability to use certain features of the App. For example, you may be able to restrict the collection of personal information or functionality through your device\'s operating system or by disabling cookies, but doing so may prevent you from using the functionality of the App. Some Internet browsers have a \u201cdo-not-track\u201d feature that let you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. However, the App does not receive, and therefore will not respond to, signals sent by Internet browser do-not-track features.
